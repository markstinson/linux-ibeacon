=============

This is a Python script that creates an Apple® [iBeacon®][IBEACON]-compatible Bluetooth LE
beacon using Linux and a Bluetooth LE adapter.

What You Need
-------------

You need a computer capable of running Linux.  It can be a desktop or notebook PC, or any
of the various single-board computers that are popular nowadays such as the [Raspberry Pi][PI]
or [Arduino YUN][YUN].

Your version of Linux must be compatible with the new [Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy][BLE] standard.
Currently this requires version 3.5 or greater of the Linux kernel.  You will
also need version 5.0 or greater of [BlueZ][BLUEZ], the Linux Bluetooth stack and associated
tools.

On most Linux distributions, BlueZ can be easily installed from your distribution's package
manager.  E.g., for Debian and Debian derivatives (Ubuntu, etc.):

`sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez-utils blueman`

Your computer must also have a Bluetooth adapter (either built-in or USB) that is compatible with
the [Bluetooth 4.0 LE][BLE] standard.  To test whether your adapter is LE-compatible, issue the
following command:

`hcitool lescan`

If you see either nothing, or a list of MAC addresses (`aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`) then your adapter
supports Bluetooth LE.  If, on the other hand, you see any error messages in the output, then
your adapter does not support LE.

If you don't have a LE-capable adapter, the [Plugable USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter][USB-BT-LE]
is an inexpensive, low-profile USB Bluetooth adapter that is known to work well with Linux.

How to use it
-------------

    Usage: sudo ibeacon [-u|--uuid UUID or `random' (default=Beacon Toolkit app)]
                        [-M|--major major (0-65535, default=0)]
                        [-m|--minor minor (0-65535, default=0)]
                        [-p|--power power (0-65535, default=200)]
                        [-d|--device (default=hci0)]
                        [-z|--down]
                        [-v|--verbose]
                        [-n|--simulate (implies -v)]
                        [-h|--help]

By default, the script creates an iBeacon whose UUID matches that which is used by the [Beacon Toolkit iOS app][BEACON-APP-IOS],
with major and minor both set to `0`.  These can be changed using the `-u`, `-M` and `-m` flags respectively.  When specifying
the UUID, you can specify an explicit UUID, or by specifying `random` the script will randomly generate a UUID.

UUID, major and minor may also be specified by setting the `IBEACON_UUID,` `IBEACON_MAJOR` and `IBEACON_MINOR` environment
variables, respectively.

To test, you will need a [device compatible with Bluetooth LE][BLE-DEVICES].  In the Apple universe, that means the iPhone 4S
or later, iPad 3rd gen or later (including Mini and Air), and the iPod touch.  For Android, you'll have to
[check the list][BLE-DEVICDES] (most phones made within the last 2 years or so should be BLE-compatible.)  Then download
either [Beacon Toolkit][BEACON-APP-IOS] (for iOS) or [iBeacon Scanner][BEACON-APP-ANDROID] (for Android.)  Fire up the app
and begin scanning.  Your newly-created iBeacon should appear in the list.  If not, check to make sure that you
specified the correct UUID, major and minor numbers.  (For iOS devices, if you used a non-default UUID, you will have to
enter it in the Beacon Toolkit app's settings screen.)
